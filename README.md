## 📌 Overview

**Harvest Harmony** is a full-stack web application built to bridge the gap between farmers and buyers through secure, transparent, and traceable **contract farming** agreements.

Farmers face numerous challenges in accessing reliable markets and securing stable incomes. Harvest Harmony provides a digital marketplace where **pre-agreed contracts**, **secure payments**, and **real-time communication** help build trust and eliminate uncertainty.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Traditional farming often suffers due to:
- Lack of stable buyers
- Price volatility
- Insecure payment practices

**Contract Farming** is a proven solution—but only if executed with transparency, trust, and accountability. Harvest Harmony provides the digital infrastructure to make that possible.
